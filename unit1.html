        <h3>1. Math Basics</h3>
        <h5>(I) Multivariable Calculus</h5>
        <p>Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or 
            predictors. Hence familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important 
            for building a machine learning model. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions of several variables</li>
            <li>Derivatives and gradients</li>
            <li>Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function</li>
            <li>Cost function</li>
            <li>Plotting of function</li>
            <li>Minimum and Maximum values of a function</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>(II) Linear Algebra</h5>
        <p>Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A dataset is represented 
            as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, and model 
            evaluation. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vectors</li>

        <h5>(III) Optimization Methods</h5>
        <p>Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective 
            function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order

    <div>
        <h3>3. Data Basics</h3>
        <p>Learn how to manipulate data in various formats, for example, CSV file, pdf file, text file, 
            etc. Learn how to clean data, impute data, scale data, import and export data, and scrap data 
            from the internet. Some packages of interest are pandas, NumPy, pdf tools, stringr, etc. 
            Additionally, R and Python contain several inbuilt datasets that can be used for practice. 
            Learn data transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques such as covariance matrix 
            plot, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

        <h3>4. Probability and Statistics Basics</h3>
        <p>Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature 
            transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model 
            evaluation, etc. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:</p>

        <h3>5. Data Visualization Basics</h3>
        <p>Learn essential components of a good data visualization. A good data visualization is made 
            up of several components that have to be pieced up together to produce an end product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Component:</strong> An important first step in deciding how to visualize data is to know what type of data it is, e.g., 
                categorical data, discrete data, continuous data, time-series data, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Geometric Component:</strong>Here is where you decide what kind of visualization is suitable for your data, e.g., scatter plot, line graphs, 
                bar plots, histograms, Q-Q plots, smooth densities, boxplots, pair plots, heatmaps, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Mapping Component:</strong>Here, you need to decide what variable to use as your x-variable and what to use as your y-variable. This is important, 
                especially when your dataset is multi-dimensional with several features.</li>
            <li><strong>scale Component:</strong>Here, you decide what kind of scales to use, e.g., linear scale, log scale, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>p-value</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Labels Component:</strong>This includes things like axes labels, titles, legends, font size to use, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Component:</strong>Here, you want to make sure your visualization tells the true story. You need to 
                be aware of your actions when cleaning, summarizing, manipulating, and producing a data visualization 
                and ensure you aren’t using your visualization to mislead or manipulate your audience.<\n><\n>
                Important data visualization tools include Python’s matplotlib and seaborn packages, and R’s ggplot2 package.</li>
            
        </ul>
