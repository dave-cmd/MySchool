        <h3>1. Math Basics</h3>
        <h5>(I) Multivariable Calculus</h5>
        <p>Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or 
            predictors. Hence familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important 
            for building a machine learning model. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions of several variables</li>
            <li>Derivatives and gradients</li>
            <li>Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function</li>
            <li>Cost function</li>
            <li>Plotting of function</li>
            <li>Minimum and Maximum values of a function</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>(II) Linear Algebra</h5>
        <p>Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A dataset is represented 
            as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, and model 
            evaluation. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vectors</li>
            <li>Matrices</li>
            <li>Transpose of a matrix</li>
            <li>The inverse of a matrix</li>
            <li>The determinant of a matrix</li>
            <li>Dot product</li>
            <li>Eigenvalues</li>
            <li>Eigenvectors</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>(III) Optimization Methods</h5>
        <p>Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective 
            function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order 
            to obtain the predicted labels. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost function/Objective function</li>
            <li>Likelihood function</li>
            <li>Error function</li>
            <li>Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Programming Basics</h3>
        <h5>(III) Optimization Methods</h5>
        <p>Python and R are considered the top programming languages for data science. You may decide to focus on 
            just one language. Python is widely adopted by industries and academic training programs. As a 
            beginner, it is recommended that you focus on one language only.<\n><\n>Here are some Python and R basics topics to master:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic R syntax</li>
            <li>Foundational R programming concepts such as data types, vectors arithmetic, indexing, and data frames</li>
            <li>How to perform operations in R including sorting, data wrangling using dplyr, and data visualization with ggplot2</li>
            <li> R studio</li>
            <li>Object-oriented programming aspects of Python</li>
            <li>Jupyter notebooks</li>
            <li>Be able to work with Python libraries such as NumPy, pylab, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch</li>

        </ul>
